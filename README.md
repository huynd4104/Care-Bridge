## ⚙️ Development & Git Guidelines

1. **Dual Remote Workflow**: Always pull from both `github` and `gitlab` remotes before pushing. Feature development is performed on personal branch `HuyND` and merged into `dev` following the project safety workflow.
2. **Granular Commits**: Commit logically separated changes by module/area using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `refactor:`).
3. **Database Migrations**: All schema modifications must be scripted as versioned Flyway migrations under `05_Development/CareBridgeAPI/src/main/resources/db/migration/`. Never modify existing applied migration files.
4. **Data Protection & Privacy**: CareBridge enforces strict access control policies on patient medical records and personal data in compliance with PDPA guidelines.
